## How We Organised the Work

We met once a week throughout the semester. Each meeting we went through what was done, discussed any problems, and assigned tasks for the following week. Everyone had a clear role from the start. Once each person finished their part, everything was collected and uploaded from one laptop — Karim's — to keep the repository clean and avoid duplicates or merge conflicts from multiple people pushing at the same time.

## GitHub Issues

We ran into two problems with GitHub that are worth explaining since they affected the commit history.

First, when the GitHub Classroom repository was created, none of us could access it. We tried multiple times over several days but kept getting access errors. Rather than wait, we created our own repository at `github.com/saffadek/heart-disease-classification` and worked from there for the entire project.

Second, when we eventually got into the classroom organisation, we still could not push files — uploads were disabled for our accounts. We only managed to get the project into the classroom repo the night before the presentation by forking it directly. Prof. van der Haar was kept informed by email throughout.

Because of all this, and because we were uploading from one machine on purpose, the commit history only shows one account. It does not reflect how the work was actually split.

## What Each Person Did

**Karim — Data Engineer & Project Lead**

Karim handled the technical side of the project. He built the full data pipeline, implemented all three models with GridSearchCV tuning, and wrote the technical sections of the report. He also built the interactive website on GitHub Pages which was used as the presentation tool. He managed the repository and all uploads throughout the project.

- Jupyter notebook — full pipeline from data loading to evaluation
- `src/preprocess.py`, `src/train.py`, `src/evaluate.py`
- GridSearchCV for all 3 models with class_weight='balanced'
- Interactive website — risk calculator, model switcher, what-if simulator
- Report sections 1–4 (Introduction, Methodology, Algorithm Selection, Results)
- Lab 12 deployment notebook
- README and repository management

**Kushul — Code Review & QA**

Kushul went through the code and results each week to check everything was correct. He verified the confusion matrix, AUC scores, recall and precision numbers, and checked the feature encoding against the original CDC dataset. He also reviewed the report for technical accuracy and covered the introduction and data sections in the presentation.

- Notebook review and reproducibility testing
- Verification of all evaluation metrics
- Encoding and stratified split validation
- Technical review of report sections 1–2
- Introduction and data presentation

**Tarik — Presentation & Communication**

Tarik was responsible for how the project was presented. He prepared the results narrative, organised the live demo walkthrough, and reviewed the website content. He also handled team communication and kept meetings on track throughout the semester.

- Presentation structure and results narrative
- Live demo walkthrough preparation
- Website content review
- Team meeting coordination

**Max — Report & Ethics**

Max owned the written quality of the report and the entire ethics section. He wrote all five ethical dimensions, the limitations section, and the conclusion. He also sourced all references and did a final proofread of the full report before submission.

- Report sections 5–6 (Ethics and Conclusion)
- All 11 academic references with DOIs
- Limitations section
- Final report proofreading and formatting
